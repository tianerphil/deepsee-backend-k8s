alembic data migration steps

I understand you want to clear the old database tables and create new ones based on your updated schema. This is a common scenario when significantly changing your database structure. Here's how you can approach this:

1. First, make sure you have Alembic installed:

pip install alembic

2. Initialize Alembic in your project:

alembic init alembic

3. Drop the existing database (be cautious with this step!):

DROP DATABASE your_database_name;
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;

You can run these SQL commands using a PostgreSQL client like psql or through a database management tool.

4. Clear Alembic migration history:
Delete all migration files in your alembic/versions/ directory, except for env.py.

5. Update env.py: setup target_metadata and setup db url

from app.models import SQLModel  # noqa
target_metadata = SQLModel.metadata


6. Update your models:
Ensure your SQLAlchemy models reflect the new database structure you want.

7. Create a new initial migration:
Run the following command:
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "New initial migration"

8. Apply the new migration:
alembic upgrade head
